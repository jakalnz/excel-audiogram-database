# excel-audiogram-database
This is an excel based audiogram database - it allows storage of patient audiograms in a format that is useful for data analysis and review.
The VBA scripts are included in the excel file. The form was developed for use in an NGO and handled 6000+ audiograms with no problems. 
Audiogram data can be saved as separate excel file either locally and/or on a Network;  or into a Register sheet within the workbook.
